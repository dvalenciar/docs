# Welcome to MDX

MDX allows you to write **Markdown** and include React components inline.

## Basic Example

This is a standard Markdown heading.

Here's a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

> Blockquotes work as expected in Markdown.

### Including JSX

You can include React components directly in your MDX file:

```jsx
<MyComponent name="Example" />
