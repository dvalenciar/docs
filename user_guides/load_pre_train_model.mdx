One of the key features of **ReinforceUI Studio** is the ability to load and analyze pre-trained models. If you have a log folder from a previous training session, you can load the model, visualize its policy performance, and observe the agent executing the task.

This feature is especially useful for:
- Reviewing a specific training session
- Comparing different models
- Refining and optimizing your models over time

3. Automatic Setup:

- The system will search for the required config file and model file.
- It will automatically create the environment and load the model.
- If successful, you will see the platform, environment, and algorithm names in green.
- If there's an issue, an error message in red will indicate what went wrong.

4. Press "Test Policy" to observe the agent executing the task.
