On this page, you will find the installation instructions for ReinforceUI Studio.

## Prerequisites
You will need:
<Accordion icon="github" title="requires">
    - Ubuntu linux (Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
    - python 3.8 or higher (Tested on python 3.10)
</Accordion>
We will take care of the rest.

## Installation

ReinforceUI Studio offers several ways to get started, allowing you to choose the method that best suits your setup:


### Run Locally

<Tip>
    Running locally means setting up ReinforceUI Studio directly on your machine. This method is ideal for users who prefer
    full control over the application and its dependencies. With just a few commands, you can have everything configured and
    ready to go, no extra tools are required.
</Tip>


<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository and install the required dependencies">
      ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:dvalenciar/ReinforceUI-Studio.git
        cd ReinforceUI-Studio
        pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the application">
      ```python
        python main.py
      ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Conda Environment
<Tip>
    Conda is a widely used package manager that simplifies dependency management and ensures compatibility across platforms.
    This method is ideal for users who want a clean, isolated environment without conflicts with other Python libraries or
    system configurations. Ensure Conda is installed on your system before proceeding.
    You can find Conda installation instructions [Conda Installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html).
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new Conda environment">
      ```bash
        conda create -n reinforceui python=3.10
        conda activate reinforceui
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the repository and install the required dependencies">
      ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:dvalenciar/ReinforceUI-Studio.git
        cd ReinforceUI-Studio
        pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the application">
    ```bash
        python main.py
    ```
  </Step>

</Steps>

### Conda Environment with YML file
<Tip>
    Another easy way to install ReinforceUI Studio in a Conda environment is to use the provided `conda_environment.yml` file.
    This file contains all the dependencies required to run the application, making the installation process even simpler.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
      ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:dvalenciar/ReinforceUI-Studio.git
        cd ReinforceUI-Studio
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new Conda environment using the `conda_environment.yml` file">
      ```bash
        conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Activate the Conda environment">
      ```bash
        conda activate reinforceui
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the application">
      ```bash
        python main.py
      ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Virtual Python Environment
<Tip>
    If you do not like Conda, a virtual Python environment is another option for installing ReinforceUI Studio.
    A virtual Python environment is an isolated setup that allows you to manage project dependencies without affecting your
    systemâ€™s Python or other projects. It's ideal for users who prefer lightweight setups without additional package managers like Conda.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new virtual Python environment">
      ```bash
        python3 -m venv reinforceui
        source reinforceui/bin/activate
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the repository">
      ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:dvalenciar/ReinforceUI-Studio.git
        cd ReinforceUI-Studio
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the required dependencies">
      ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the application">
      ```bash
        python main.py
      ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Docker Container

<Tip>
    Docker is a popular containerization tool that simplifies the deployment of applications across different platforms.
    This method is perfect for users who want a hassle-free, isolated setup without worrying about managing dependencies.
    Make sure Docker is installed on your system. Docker installation instructions [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
</Tip>

To make it even easier, we have already provided a pre-built image, ready to run in a Docker container.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull the ReinforceUI Studio Docker image:">
      ```bash
            docker pull ghcr.io/dvalenciar/reinforceui-studio:latest
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Docker container">
      ```bash
        xhost +local:
        docker run -it --rm   -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY   -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix   -v /home/{user_name}:/root/logs   reinforceui-studio bash
      ```
      You can get your `{user_name}` by running: `whoami`, for example, in my case, the full command is:
      ```bash
        docker run -it --rm   -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY   -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix   -v /home/david:/root/logs  reinforceui-studio bash
      ```
  </Step>

    <Step title="Inside the docker container, run the application: ">
        ```bash
            python main.py
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  There are some issues with the docker folder log and some video records; we are working on it.
