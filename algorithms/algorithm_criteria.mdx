title: "Algorithm Inclusion Criteria"
---

ReinforceUI-Studio is committed to providing a set of high-quality algorithms for the RL community. To ensure the reliability and relevance of our offerings, we follow strict criteria for including new algorithms:

## Requirements for Inclusion
Algorithm must meet one or more of the following criteria:

- **Peer-Reviewed**: The algorithm must be published in a peer-reviewed venue.
- **Top-Tier Publication**: It should appear in a well-known academic conference or journal in the fields of Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, JMLR).
- **Community Recognition**: The algorithm should be recognized and widely used within the RL community.

## Suggesting New Algorithms
We are open to expanding our collection! If you have an algorithm you believe should be included, you can:

- **Email Us**: Send your suggestion to [support@reinforceui-studio.com]
- **Open a Pull Request**: If your algorithm is ready for integration, submit a pull request to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dvalenciar/ReinforceUI-Studio).

All submissions will be reviewed to ensure they meet our standards and benefit the RL community.
