This section presents the key mathematical foundations and fundamental concepts that underpin RL. It covers specialized techniques and equations essential for understanding how agents learn, make decisions, and optimize their behavior. These principles will serve as the theoretical basis for the following sections.

<Tip>
  It is completely normal to need multiple readings to grasp these concepts fully. If you find them a bit confusing at first, that's perfectly okay—everyone experiences this. Don't get discouraged! With time and practice, these ideas will become much clearer. Keep going!

A **policy** is essentially the strategy an agent uses to decide what actions to take in different situations. It tells the agent what to do when it's in a specific state. Policies are typically divided into two types:

1. **Stochastic Policy**: This type of policy involves randomness. Instead of choosing a single action, the agent picks from a set of actions based on probabilities. For example, the agent might have a 70% chance of choosing action A and a 30% chance of choosing action B.

2. **Deterministic Policy**: With this policy, the agent always chooses the same action for a given state. There's no randomness—each state is mapped to exactly one action.
